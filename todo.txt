==== newer stuff ====
- make index.html a true template and incorporate the nav_bar rendering system

==== Notes from Rat Race 2017 ====
- check that handle_reset_confirm is being done the "right" way

- "NOT" split into
-- "NOT" = known to not be flying today
-- "" (blank) = reset to start the day

- NEW status options
-- LMB ("Landed per Mary Beth"): bright yellow, so not LOK, but still known to be safe
-- SMB ("See Mary Beth"): orange, so not FLY, but did not go properly and needs education
- Probably should change to more generic codes, for example
-- LMB -> LFX (Landed, but LOK message needs to be fixed)
-- SMB -> ERR (Inproper messages, see Retrieve Coordinator or Organizer)

- SPOT MESSAGE PARSING ISSUES (still?!)

- Convert incoming status message to upper (gt needs to check: this might be fixed)

- review the log file to confirm it has all pertainent message processing details
-- confirm log date stamps in local time zone

- extract lat/lon from parsable messages (look for 'll='' and '(4[12]\.' and ...?)

- convert lat/lon to clickable map link

- embed map on pilotview page (with pin on last known pilot location)

- Auto-update (reload) Overview page

- Warm restart (renew latest status message, use /refresh and have another verify step)

- organizer view (hidden/pw protected from public)
-- direct access to "Logs" view
-- direct access to /reset
-- direct access to /refresh

- /pilotview/### (direct access for a pilot to their own status and messages received)

- Update "acknowledge" message to be more specific. For example "Received #172 LOK"

- Check that the # of connections is sufficient (all pilots checking their status)


==== PREVIOUS TO DO ITEMS ====
- require authentication for debug and complete pilot details
X check for sample SPOT message
X turn on/configure new phone number
- update views
  - overview page
    X get the color key working again
    X get number to pop
    X show sample of all statuses
  - single pilot page
    - simple URL bowerbird.meteor.com/7
    X show message/status history, most current first
- SPOT stuff
  - got an LOK from a SPOT, send ACK to associated cell phone
- retrieve handling
  - assign retrieve driver:
    - GT sends 7 RZA to Twillio/bowerbird
      - bowerbird sends pilot a driver assignment
      - bowerbird sends driver a pilot and location
    * can i send a message to multiple recipients?
- robustify message parsing
  X parse SPOT messages
  X parse DeLorme messages
  X handle leading spaces
  X parse lat/lon out of DeLorme messages
  X parse lat/lon out of SPOT messages
  - add feedback for invalid pilot number
